### Requirements of Tests ###

The purpose of the tests will be to (1) ensure that the database correctly
creates tables and inserts the required data with proper data types, (2) check the
appropriate files exist, and (3) determine the routes are performing their functions.
Thus, the scope of the tests will include the database connection, functionality, and output of routes.
The inputs will be the HTTP requests, SQL statements (tables created, data inserted, analysis of data) and
the presence of necessary files. The outputs will be two tables: (1) enclosures
with an id and name and (2) animals with id, animal name, quantity of animal, and
enclosure they belong to. The latter will require a foreign key so the tables will
be connected via JOIN. A report of the tests (with descriptions) must also be created.
The tests will assume that the data are class objects and that all names are strings
and id's/quantities are integers. It will also use logging, os, python-dotenv, and psycopg2,
where the latter requires python version 3.10.7 so this is a contraint of the test.
Other constraints are that only three tests will be used and they will be unit tests only.
A potential issue could be multiple species in the same enclosure, or one species in multiple enclosures.

### User Stories ###

As a developer, I want to be able to run the appropriate unit tests to ensure my flask app
has all the necessary files and creates/imports the necessary databases/data.

As a user, I want to be able to insert data using the correct data types so that its calculations
can be accurately maintained and analyzed.
